## Vscode snippet generator
Generate vscode snippets from markdown files

### Why ?
Vscode snippets are quite weird with their array syntax for the snippet body and it might be cool
if you could categories snippets into folders and files.

### How to use it ?

run the code
```
$ git clone 
$ node ./generator.js
```

your snippets will be generated in respestive .json files copy and paste them into vscode.


### Todo
- [ ] Figure out was way to copy snippets into vscode automatically (should work cross platform)
